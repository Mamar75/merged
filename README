Objective: merging Compustat prices, market capitalization and accounting data with shares owned.

(1) 'merge_compustat_shares_owned.py' will merge compustat from 1997 to 2024 with the current shares owned file.
Output: pair_data.csv
(2) 'select_pairs.ipynb' will remove all financial pairs.
Output: pair_data_nf.csv
(3) 'merge_pairs_data_accounting.py' will merge the dataset obtained in (2) with compustat quarterly observations
for market capitalization and some accounting values such as the share owner equity. Will use a forward fill. In order
to have a market capitalisation time series that starts in 1998 (and not 2006) it also adds the annual market
capitalisation time series.
Output: pair_data_nf_acc.csv
(4) 'analyze.py' will analyze the dataset produced in (3).
Output: nsv_description.csv
